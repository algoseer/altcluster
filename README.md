# altcluster
Exploring alternate ways to achieve clustering of data preferably in a discriminative fashion

1. bottle_clust: Use a softmax layer in the bottleneck of an AE to cluster data. This is similar in principal to using a mixture model.
2. par_clust : Learn multiple transformations of data at the same time. Use them to self supervise.
